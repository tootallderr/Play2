Guidelines:
- Add [‚úì Correct] for accurate statements
- Add [‚ùå Incorrect: actual fact] for wrong information  
- Add [‚ö†Ô∏è Disputed: brief explanation] for controversial topics
- Add [üìä Context: additional info] for statements needing context
- Keep additions concise and informative
- Don't fact-check obvious fictional content
- Focus on historical dates, scientific claims, statistics, etc.

Example:
Original: "The Great Wall of China is visible from space."
Transformed: "The Great Wall of China is visible from space. [‚ùå Incorrect: Not visible to naked eye from space]"
